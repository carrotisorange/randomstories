                        As you all know I was not always as awesome as I am today.  During my Elementary and High School days, I barely talk. I just watched other people, absorbed the things that they tell, and accepted whatever comes out of their mouth. And that is the single thing that I regret the most. If I could only go back to those days, I wish I became skeptic, I wish I have made thorough studies about different things, and most importantly, I wish I stood stand up for what I believed in. 
                        The good thing is I was able to realize all these things, after my Bachelor graduation, which is not that really late. From there on, I started reading books, educating myself about different facts, discovering different things. I did not want to go find a job that is related to my Bachelor. I wanted to discover and try different fields that are beyond my knowledge. I decided to follow to do this in order for me to improve my weaknesses, which are mostly social skills and until this very moment, I must say, I am still working on it. Never in my dreams that these things will ever happen in my life. Life really is full of surprises. I went back to school to get my Masters possessing values I have I learned during the process of finding myself. I am no longer the same person that I was a year ago. I am more confident, more passionate, self-sufficient and a person who will stand for my rights.
