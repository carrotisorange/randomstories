                        I know you’ve been going through a lot recently because you’re homesick and the pregnancy scare as well and I just want you to know that I'm anguish too because I can’t do anything to help ease that pain. 
                        I’m lucky I still this lastlast paper from the first letter I gave to you and thought this might cheer you up. This is just a freestyle writing. 
                        I’ll write everything that pops out on my head. 
                        Please bear with my calligraphy. It’s been so long since I wrote you one. Lol
                        You’re a strong woman, loving daughter, sweet sister to your siblings and to your pamangkins as well, a good friend, and a thoughtful girlfriend. 
                        From all the stories you told me about you’re past and your journey you still managed to survive because I know you’re strong. 
                        And in no time, you’ll achieve all your dreams and I hope I’m there when that time comes. 
                        To be honest, I’ve been busting my ass out to work and even new things just to distract myself. I’m a very secretive person. 
                        I never tell anything to anyone but you. You’re an exception. But every time you’re gonna get mad and tell me I’m ungrateful person. 
                        I feel so lost. I kind of question everything about my life. I question my identity.
