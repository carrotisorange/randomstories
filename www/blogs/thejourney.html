                        It all began when I got my Bachelor degree, a month after my graduation, while almost all of my batchmates were already landed their first job. I was lost. Those days were the darkest moments of my life. I did not know what to do. I earned my Bachelor degree in Computer Science at one of the best School in the Philippines and yet, at some point, I felt worthless. I felt like I was not good enough. I did not know who really am I. I said to my inner self, "I am not yet ready for this." There was something in my life that has to be filled up first before I start this new journey. 
                        I went to bookstores to find some books that I could read in order for me to discover that something. Meanwhile, my parents and relatives were really pressuring me to find a job, as soon as possible, because that how it works right? You graduate, you work, and help them financially until everything is already being taken care of, and the cycle will continue until you have your own grandsons and great great great grandsons. But, I say, "Hey, I don't want to be part of that cycle. "And so, I wanted it to stop on my generation. I focused on improving myself first. I went to a BPO company, a company where I can learn how to be fluent in the English language. English is the universal language. Through English, you can read all the best books available out there and you can go wherever you want to go. Knowing how to speak and write in English is a good foundation in order to succeed in whatever profession.
