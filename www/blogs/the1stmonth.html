                        This day marks the first month since you let me be your man. Time have flown so fast and I couldn’t ask for more, well aside from being successful in my career and then, build my company, and be a millionaire, and erect a mansion for my biological family, and the other 101 more which I don’t want covered in this letter. (AYYYY HAHAHA). 
                        This day is one of the many milestones a couple could ever accomplished and I’m grateful we made it. I’ve been connected to WIFI for the longest time, but I found the connection with you.
                        This day is a very special day for both of us. The relationship that we have is the relationship that I want and I hope what Luke and Leiah will also find. Let’s enjoy our time together and be as bold as we could be as long as we can without compromising our personal dreams and agendas in this wonderful life.
                        P.S. There are lots more to be thankful for than to be stressed about. Just always give your best shot in everything that you do, so that you only have to do it once. I’ll be there when it gets difficult. I love you!
