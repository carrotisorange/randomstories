                        My life has never been the same since you came. By that, I would like to quote an amazing person, “My days are better since you came.” (for the better experience please close your eyes and do inhale-exhale at least once.)
                        Believe or not, I’ve never been so closed and attached to any person before. For the past three months that we’ve been constantly talking virtually, I have to admit that I’ve never been so happy. The feeling that I had when I first heard your voice on my phone was irrevocable and ineffable at the same time. As the time goes by and suddenly, we take things to another level, we’ve started to do long night calls as if were in LDR. I was so overwhelmed and for a moment I felt like I was kid again. I was in my comfort place, got nothing to worry about the future and just enjoy the rain and just go with the flow. During those moments, it occurred to me, that this is the sort of thing in life that you’ll never know you need until you experienced it. Some part of me just died only to reborn with enthusiasm and hope. 
                        I was the kind of person who was not really into relationships, you know. All those commitments, emotions, responsibilities, idiosyncrasies, and dramas were not my thing. It makes me feel that I’m not in control of my own life, that I won’t be able to things that I want anymore and therefore I’m not gonna grow. But all of those beliefs and perceptions about what relationships looks like suddenly changed, those are just things in my past now. 
                        Being with you made me realize that relationship is fun. Having someone whom you can share about your days and life with is priceless and can never be compared to any luxury items and expensive hobbies. 
                        Things happen for a reason and for whatever reason why you came into my life, one thing is for sure, I’ll never be the same again and those memories that we had will be treasured forever. And whatever next thing that will happen to us after this night I’ll accept it. I love you baby! Let me be your man.
